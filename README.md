## Hi there ðŸ¦†

Iâ€™m Kurt BÃ¶hm, a PhD student at TU Clausthalâ€™s Institute of Mathematics in the research group on Scientific Computing with a Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science.

My current work focuses on _Lineal_, an efficient parallel linear algebra library written in moden C++, as well as other C++ libraries connected to it.
Some of my other projects include `pysemco`, a Python library for semantic code highlighting, a collection of LaTeX packages (including one for code highlighting), and _Illuminata_ (in reference to [Pentiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentiment_(video_game))), a high-quality PDF viewer designed for presentations.
Additionally, I have always been very interested in computer graphics, though any related projects are not public (yet).

I mostly write C++, Python, and LaTeX, but I am open to using other languages if there is a good reason for it.
In the past, I used quite a bit of Kotlin and Java, but rarely use them these days.
I have also written some C, Swift, Rust, and TypeScript/JavaScript, among other languages.
