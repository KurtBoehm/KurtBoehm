## Hi there ðŸ¦†

Iâ€™m Kurt BÃ¶hm, a PhD student at TU Clausthalâ€™s Institute of Mathematics in the research group on Scientific Computing with a Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science.

My current work focuses on [_Lineal_](https://github.com/KurtBoehm/lineal), an efficient parallel linear algebra library written in modern C++, as well as other C++ libraries connected to it (such as [_Thesauros_](https://github.com/KurtBoehm/thesauros)).
Some of my other projects include [`pysemco`](https://github.com/KurtBoehm/pysemco), a Python library for semantic code highlighting, [a collection of LaTeX packages](https://github.com/KurtBoehm/latex-packages) (including one for code highlighting using `pysemco`), and [_Illuminata_](https://github.com/KurtBoehm/Illuminata) (in reference to [Pentiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentiment_(video_game))), a high-quality PDF viewer designed for presentations.
Additionally, I have always been very interested in computer graphics, though any related projects are not public (yet).

I mostly write C++, Python, and LaTeX, but I am open to using other languages if there is a good reason for it.
In the past, I used quite a bit of Kotlin and Java, but rarely use them these days.
I have also written some C, Swift, Rust, and TypeScript/JavaScript, among other languages.
